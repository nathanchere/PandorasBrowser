# Pandora's Browser

Intended to mess with open WiFi hotspots at cafes etc. Could also be fun to leave running at work to catch out employers monitoring what everyone is doing but use at your own risk.

NOTE
----

Old project imported from my personal SVN server to Google Code. Links long since dead and code removed for legal reasons. If you really want a copy for something, there is apparently at least one torrent floating around but i would know nothing about that.
